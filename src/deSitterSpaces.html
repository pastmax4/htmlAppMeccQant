            <h3>Our universe is curved or flat the simplest answer  </h3>               
            <p>
                <div>
                In 4D (3 space and 1 time, often called 3+1 space), our universe is curved. <br>
                But for just the 3 dimensions of
                space, it is flat. 
                (From now on, when we say our universe is “flat” we will mean as close to flat as we can currently
                measure. Any curvature, if it exists, is very small.) <br>
                The 3 spatial dimensions of the universe are flat space-wise, but
                the whole thing <b> is curved when we include the time dimension.</b>

            <h3>Slicing Higher Dimensional Spaces into Lower Dimensional Ones </h3>               
            <p>
                Note from the LHS of Figure 1, we can have a flat 3D space (a volume) with a curved 2D space (a surface)
                embedded in it. The classic example is of a sphere in our 3D spatially flat (Euclidean) universe. In the figure, we
                show a hemisphere, for ease of visualization. The surface of the (hemi)sphere is a curved 2D surface

                </figure>
                But the converse is also true. We can have a curved space with a lower dimensional
                flat space embedded in it,
                as shown heuristically in the RHS of Figure 1. We can slice a 3D curved space (which is a little hard to visualize,
                though we tried in Figure 1) in such a way that the 2D space embedded in it is flat.
                <br> <br>
                <b>
                In essence, whether a space is curved or not, we can generally pick out a “slice” 
                of it in one lower dimension that is either curved or flat. 
                </b>
                <br> <br>

                The formal name for slicing in this
                context is <b> foliation</b>.  <br>
                We foliate a higher D space to get a lower D space. <br>
                For any given space, there are a slew [generally infinite] number 
                of ways we can foliate to get lower dimension spaces of our choosing. <br>

                We have shown 3D space foliation to get 2D spaces, 
                but the same principle applies to any d  imensions <br>
                For example, we can foliate our 4D universe and get our 3D spatial 
                universe at one point in time.Similarly, we can
                foliate a 5D space to get an embedded 4D space. 
                Or a 6D space to get an embedded 5D space, etc. <br> <br>
                
                When we talk, for example, of slicing (foliating) a 4D space to get a 3D space, 
                we call the 4D space a <b> hypervolume,</b> and the 3D space, a <b> hypersurface.</b>
                Likewise, any space of dimension greater than three can be termed a hypervolume 
                and the subspace obtained from foliating that, a hypersurface.

        <article id="ourFlat3DSpatialUniverse">      
            <h3>Our Flat 3D Spatial Universe </h3>               
            <p>
                So, our universe is a curved hypervolume when we consider it in the full 
                four dimensions of space and time. <br> <br>
                When we consider only the 3D spatial part, as a hypersurface embedded 
                in 4D spacetime, that hypersurface is flat. <br> <br>
                
                Note, we can also conceptualize our curved 4D universe as embedded in a flat 5D space. From that perspective,
                we have a 5D flat space with an embedded 4D curved space. But then, the 4D curved space has a flat 3D (spatial)
                space embedded in it.

        <article id="positiveNegativeCurvature">      
            <h3>Positive vs Negative Curvature </h3>               
            <p>
            <div>
                The 2D surface of a sphere is deemed by convention to have <b> positive curvature.</b> 
                If you start at any point on it,
                and move in any direction, you will curve “downward” in the same way. <br> <br>

                The 2D surface of a saddle, on the other hand, is different. 
                See Figure 2. If you start at some point, such as the
                middle of the saddle, and move in one direction, 
                you will curve downward. If you start at the same point, but move
                in a perpendicular direction, you will curve upward. 
                This kind of curvature is called <b> negative curvature </b> <br> <br>

                So if you move
                in two directions perpendicular to each other, if you curve in the same way the  space is positively curved,
                if you move in opposite ways the  space is negatively curved.
                
                if you are on a flat 2D surface, you won’t curve at all in any direction: zero curvature. 
                Similarly for higher dimension spaces. <br> <br>

                There are degrees of curvature, the value for curvature of a 2D surface on a 3D
                sphere is inversely proportional to the sphere radius squared:

                $$ 
                    R \propto   \frac{1}{r^2}

                $$

                For higher dimensional spaces, curvature R is inversely proportional 
                to the square of a radius-like number,
                which would correspond to a “sphere” in higher dimensions than 3.  <br> <br>

                Saddle shapes have negative curvature. The r value here corresponds to what the radius
                would be of a circle whose circumference is aligned with either 
                of the two perpendicular directions, i.e., the circle
                has the same curvature as that section of the saddle. <br>
                So, for a negatively shaped surface in any dimension, we will have curvature R.
                $$ 
                    R \propto   - \frac{1}{r^2}
                $$

                Note that the <b> curvature of the surface of a sphere is constant everywhere.</b>
                Wherever we measure we have the
                same value for radius r, and thus the same curvature R.
                <br> <br>

                For a surface that is not so uniform, such as an egg, 
                the surface curvature R would be different at the
                ends than at the middle.  <br> <br>

                An object in any dimension is said to have <b> maximal symmetry if the curvature everywhere is the same.</b>
                Hence, a sphere surface has maximum symmetry, 
                whereas that of an egg shell and a mountain’s terrain do not. <br> <br>

                In general, for hypersurface dimension D,
                $$ 
                R \propto   \frac{D(D-1)}{r^2}
            $$
