            <h3>The Quantum Mechanics of Photon Polarization: a Simple Experiment</h3>  
            <p> 
                This experiment can be performed by the reader using only minimal equipment: a laser pointer and three polaroids
                (polarization filters), readily available from any camera supply store. <br><br>

                <b>#1</b> Shine a beam of light on a projection screen. When polaroid A is placed between the light source
                and the screen, the intensity of the light reaching the screen is reduced. Let us suppose that the
                polarization of polaroid A is horizontal.

                </figure>

                <b>#2</b> Next, place polaroid C between polaroid A and the projection screen. If polaroid C is rotated
                so that its polarization is orthogonal (vertical) to the polarization of A, no light reaches the screen
                (figure 2).

                <b>#3</b> Finally, place polaroid B between polaroids A and C. <br>
                One might expect that adding another
                polaroid will not make any difference; if no light got through two polaroids, then surely no light
                will pass through three! Surprisingly, at most polarization angles of B, light shines on the screen.
                The intensity of this light will be maximal if the polarization of B is at 45 degrees to both A and
                C (figure 3).

        <h3>Quantum Explanation</h3>  
        <article id="spiegazione esperimento">      
            <p>
                Quantum mechanics models a photon’s polarization state by a unit vector, a vector of length
                1, pointing in the appropriate direction. <br>
                This is the representation of vertical and horizontal polarization respectively:

                $$  |\to  \rangle ,  |\uparrow  \rangle $$


                Call \( |v \rangle  \)  a vector representing a quantum state (according to Dirac’s notation). <br>
                An arbitrary polarization can be expressed as a linear combination:
                
                $$  |v \rangle  \ = a|\uparrow  \rangle  +  b|\to  \rangle $$

                \(  |\to  \rangle ,  |\uparrow  \rangle  \) are a basis. <br>
                \( |v \rangle  \) is a superposition of  \(  |\to  \rangle ,  |\uparrow  \rangle  \). 
                <br><br>

                
                The polaroid has a preferred axis, its polarization. <br>

                When a photon with its own polarization meets a polaroid, the photon will get through vertical polarization 
                with probability \( a^2  \) and through horizontal polarization with  probability \( b^2  \). <br>
                In general the probability that a photon passes through the polaroid is the square of the magnitude 
                of the amplitude of its polarization in the direction of the polaroid’s preferred axis. 
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/quantumComputing/polaroid01.jpg" alt="polarizzazione" title="Direzione di polarizzazione" width="200"
                        height="185">
                    <figcaption>
                        Fig. Polaroid’s preferred axis </span>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                $$  p^2 = a^2 + b^2 $$


                Furthermore, any photon that passes through the polaroid will be polarized in the direction of
                the polaroid’s preferred axis. In the experiment, any photons that pass through polaroid A
                will leave polarized in the direction of polaroid A’s preferred axis. In Fig. 1 we have horizontal
                polarization, so all photons passing through A will be horizontal polarized with 
                no amplitude in the vertical direction: no chance of passing through polaroid C (Fig.2) 
                vertically oriented. For this reason, no light reaches the screen.
                If C had a different orientation it would have a component along horizontal axis with a probability
                not to be stopped. <br>
                Inserting polaroid B (its angle is 45°) photons have 1/2 probability to pass through and now all photons
                emerging from B are polarized in this direction. When these photons hit polaroid C, half have amplitude
                in the vertical direction and can hit the screen.

        <h3>Single Quantum Bit</h3>  
        <article id="quantum bit">      
            <p>
                The space of possible polarization states of a photon is an example of a quantum bit, or qubit. A
                qubit has a continuum of possible values:
                $$  |v \rangle  \ = a|\uparrow  \rangle  +  b|\to  \rangle $$
                
                The amplitudes a and b can be complex numbers (in this case circular polarization).
                the set of all possible states of a physical system is called the state space of the
                system. <br>
                Any quantum mechanical system that can be modeled by a two-dimensional complex
                vector space can be viewed as a qubit: photon polarization, electron spin, and the ground state
                together with an excited state of an atom. <br>
                The two-state label for these systems does not mean that the state space has only two states—it has infinitely many—but rather that all possible states can be
                represented as a linear combination, or superposition, of just two states
            </p>

            <p class="riquadro">
                The two-state label for these systems does not mean that the
                state space has only two states—it has infinitely many—but rather that all possible states can be

            <p>
                For a two-dimensional complex vector space to be viewed as a qubit, two linearly independent states, 
                must be distinguished. For the theory of quantum information processing, all two-state systems,
                whether they be electron spin or energy levels of an atom, are equally good. From a practical
                point of view, it is as yet unclear which two-state systems will be most suitable for physical
                realizations of quantum information processing devices such as quantum computers. <br>
                Two linearly independent states can be labeled as:

                $$  |0  \rangle ,  |1  \rangle $$

                Given complex vector space V and a set of vectors S. <br>
                S generates the complex vector space V if:

                $$  |v  \rangle = a_1 |s_1 \rangle + a_2 |s_2 \rangle + ... a_n |s_n \rangle $$

                for every \( |v \rangle \) in  V and for some elements  \( |s_i \rangle \)in  S with complex numbers \( a_i \). <br>
                <br>
                Given a set of vectors S, the subspace of all linear combinations of vectors in S is called the span of S and
                is denoted span(S). <br> <br>

                A set of vectors B for which every element of V can be written uniquely as a linear combination
                of vectors in B is called a   <b>basis </b> basis for V.

                In a two-dimensional vector space, any two vectors that are not multiples of

            <p>
                An inner product or dot product, on a complex vector space V is a complex function
                defined on pairs of vectors in V, we rapresent it as:

                $$  \langle v_2 | v_1 \rangle $$

                inner product must satisfy these properties:

                <ul>
                    <li>\(  \langle v | v \rangle \) is non-negative real </li>
                    <li> \(  \langle v_1 | v_2 \rangle  =     ( \langle v_2 | v_1 \rangle  )^*     \)</li>
                    <li>\(  (a\langle v_2 | + b\langle v_3 |) | v_1 \rangle  =  a\langle v_2 | v_1 \rangle + b\langle v_3 | v_1 \rangle    \)   </li>
                </ul> 
                Inoltre valgono queste proprietà

                    <li>\( \{  |\beta_1  \rangle,|\beta_2  \rangle,...,|\beta_n  \rangle \}  \)            A set of vectors is said to be orthonormal if all of its elements are of length
                        one and orthogonal to each other: \(  \langle \beta_i | \beta_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}   \)    </li>

        <h3>Quantum bit</h3>  
        <article id="Quantum bit">      
            <p>
                For the state space of a two-state system to represent a quantum bit, two orthonormal distinguished
                must be specified, we labeled these as:
                $$  | 0 \rangle $$
                $$  | 1 \rangle $$

                the states may be chosen arbitrarily. For instance, in the case of photon polarization,
                we may choose as:

                $$  | 0 \rangle \to    |\to  \rangle $$
                $$  | 1 \rangle \to     |\uparrow  \rangle $$

                qubits can take on not only the values |0 and |1 but also any superposition
                of these values <br>
