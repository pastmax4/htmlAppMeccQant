            <h3>The Quantum Mechanics of Photon Polarization: a Simple Experiment</h3>  
            <p> 
                This experiment can be performed by the reader using only minimal equipment: a laser pointer and three polaroids
                (polarization filters), readily available from any camera supply store. <br><br>

                <b>#1</b> Shine a beam of light on a projection screen. When polaroid A is placed between the light source
                and the screen, the intensity of the light reaching the screen is reduced. Let us suppose that the
                polarization of polaroid A is horizontal.

                </figure>

                <b>#2</b> Next, place polaroid C between polaroid A and the projection screen. If polaroid C is rotated
                so that its polarization is orthogonal (vertical) to the polarization of A, no light reaches the screen
                (figure 2).

                <b>#3</b> Finally, place polaroid B between polaroids A and C. <br>
                One might expect that adding another
                polaroid will not make any difference; if no light got through two polaroids, then surely no light
                will pass through three! Surprisingly, at most polarization angles of B, light shines on the screen.
                The intensity of this light will be maximal if the polarization of B is at 45 degrees to both A and
                C (figure 3).

        <h3>Quantum Explanation</h3>  
        <article id="spiegazione esperimento">      
            <p>
                Quantum mechanics models a photon’s polarization state by a unit vector, a vector of length
                1, pointing in the appropriate direction. <br>
                This is the representation of vertical and horizontal polarization respectively:

                $$  |\to  \rangle ,  |\uparrow  \rangle $$


                Call \( |v \rangle  \)  a vector representing a quantum state (according to Dirac’s notation). <br>
                An arbitrary polarization can be expressed as a linear combination:
                
                $$  |v \rangle  \ = a|\uparrow  \rangle  +  b|\to  \rangle $$

                \(  |\to  \rangle ,  |\uparrow  \rangle  \) are a basis. <br>
                \( |v \rangle  \) is a superposition of  \(  |\to  \rangle ,  |\uparrow  \rangle  \). 
                <br><br>

                
                The polaroid has a preferred axis, its polarization. <br>

                When a photon with its own polarization meets a polaroid, the photon will get through vertical polarization 
                with probability \( a^2  \) and through horizontal polarization with  probability \( b^2  \). <br>
                In general the probability that a photon passes through the polaroid is the square of the magnitude 
                of the amplitude of its polarization in the direction of the polaroid’s preferred axis. 
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/quantumComputing/polaroid01.jpg" alt="polarizzazione" title="Direzione di polarizzazione" width="200"
                        height="185">
                    <figcaption>
                        Fig. Polaroid’s preferred axis </span>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                $$  p^2 = a^2 + b^2 $$


                Furthermore, any photon that passes through the polaroid will be polarized in the direction of
                the polaroid’s preferred axis. In the experiment, any photons that pass through polaroid A
                will leave polarized in the direction of polaroid A’s preferred axis. In Fig. 1 we have horizontal
                polarization, so all photons passing through A will be horizontal polarized with 
                no amplitude in the vertical direction: no chance of passing through polaroid C (Fig.2) 
                vertically oriented. For this reason, no light reaches the screen.
                If C had a different orientation it would have a component along horizontal axis with a probability
                not to be stopped. <br>
                Inserting polaroid B (its angle is 45°) photons have 1/2 probability to pass through and now all photons
                emerging from B are polarized in this direction. When these photons hit polaroid C, half have amplitude
                in the vertical direction and can hit the screen.

        <h3>Single Quantum Bit</h3>  
        <article id="quantum bit">      
            <p>
                The space of possible polarization states of a photon is an example of a quantum bit, or qubit. A
                qubit has a continuum of possible values:
                $$  |v \rangle  \ = a|\uparrow  \rangle  +  b|\to  \rangle $$
                
                The amplitudes a and b can be complex numbers (in this case circular polarization).
                the set of all possible states of a physical system is called the state space of the
                system. <br>
                Any quantum mechanical system that can be modeled by a two-dimensional complex
                vector space can be viewed as a qubit: photon polarization, electron spin, and the ground state
                together with an excited state of an atom. <br>
                The two-state label for these systems does not mean that the state space has only two states—it has infinitely many—but rather that all possible states can be
                represented as a linear combination, or superposition, of just two states
            </p>

            <p class="riquadro">

            <p>
                For a two-dimensional complex vector space to be viewed as a qubit, two linearly independent states, 
                must be distinguished. For the theory of quantum information processing, all two-state systems,
                whether they be electron spin or energy levels of an atom, are equally good. From a practical
                point of view, it is as yet unclear which two-state systems will be most suitable for physical
                realizations of quantum information processing devices such as quantum computers. <br>
                Two linearly independent states can be labeled as:

                $$  |0  \rangle ,  |1  \rangle $$

        <article id="Measurements of single-qubit systems">      
            <p>
                Quantum theory postulates that any device that measures a two-state quantum system must have
                two preferred states that form an orthonormal basis for the associated vector space:

                $$ \{  u, u_{\bot }  \}$$
                $$ |v \rangle =  a|u \rangle + b |u_{\bot } \rangle   $$

                Measurement of a state transforms the state into one of the measuring
                device’s associated basis vectors  \(   u, u_{\bot }  \);
                
                the state \(   |v \rangle  \) is measured as  \(|u \rangle \) with probability \(   a^2  \) and
                as  \(  |u_{\bot }  \rangle  \) with probability \(   b^2  \)
                
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="riquadro">
                    This behavior of measurement is an axiom of quantum mechanics. It is not derivable from
                    other physical principles; rather, it is derived from the empirical observation of experiments with
                    measuring devices.

                then the state \(   |v \rangle   \) changes to  \(  |u \rangle  \).
                
                A second measurement with respect to the same basis will
                return 
                $$  |u \rangle  $$
                with probability 1. <br>

                Thus, unless the original state happens to be one of the basis states,
                a single measurement will change the original state, making it impossible to determine the original state
                from any sequence of measurements.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because the result of measuring a superposition is probabilistic, some people are tempted
                to think of the state as a probabilistic mixture of  \( |0 \rangle,  |1 \rangle \). It is not.


                Rather, the vector state is a definite state, which, when measured in certain bases, gives deterministic results,
                while in others it gives random results: a photon with a certain polarization 
                behaves deterministically when measured with respect to the Hadamard basis for example but it gives
                random results when measured with respect to the standard basis.

                Given that qubits can take on any one of infinitely many states, one might hope that a single
                qubit could store lots of classical information. <br>
                However, the properties of quantum measurement severely restrict the amount of information that 
                can be extracted from a qubit. Information about a quantum bit can be obtained only by measurement, 
                and any measurement results in one of only
                two states, the two basis states associated with the measuring device; <br> thus,  <b> a single measurement yields at most a single classical bit of information. Because measurement changes the state, one
                cannot make two measurements on the original state of a qubit.</b>
            </p>

            <p class="riquadro">
                Furthermore, 
                an unknown quantum state cannot be cloned, which means it is not possible to measure a
                qubit’s state in two ways, even indirectly by copying the qubit’s state and measuring the copy.
            </p>
            <p class="riquadro">
                Thus, even though a quantum bit can be in infinitely many different superposition states, it is
                possible to extract only a single classical bit of information from a single quantum bit.
