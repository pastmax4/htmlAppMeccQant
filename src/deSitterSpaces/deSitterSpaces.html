            <h3>Our universe is curved or flat the simplest answer  </h3>

                <div class="duecolonne">
                In 4D (3 space and 1 time, often called 3+1 space), our universe is curved. <br>
                But for just the 3 dimensions of
                space, it is flat. 
                (From now on, when we say our universe is “flat” we will mean as close to flat as we can currently
                measure. Any curvature, if it exists, is very small.) <br>
                The 3 spatial dimensions of the universe are flat space-wise, but
                the whole thing <b> is curved when we include the time dimension.</b>

                Note from the LHS of Figure 1, we can have a flat 3D space (a volume) with a curved 2D space (a surface)
                embedded in it. The classic example is of a sphere in our 3D spatially flat (Euclidean) universe. In the figure, we
                show a hemisphere, for ease of visualization. The surface of the (hemi)sphere is a curved 2D surface

                </figure>
                But the converse is also true. We can have a curved space with a lower dimensional
                flat space embedded in it,
                as shown heuristically in the RHS of Figure 1. We can slice a 3D curved space (which is a little hard to visualize,
                though we tried in Figure 1) in such a way that the 2D space embedded in it is flat.
                <br> <br>
                <b>
                In essence, whether a space is curved or not, we can generally pick out a “slice” 
                of it in one lower dimension that is either curved or flat. 
                </b>
                <br> <br>

                The formal name for slicing in this
                context is <b> foliation</b>.  <br>
                We foliate a higher D space to get a lower D space. <br>
                For any given space, there are a slew [generally infinite] number 
                of ways we can foliate to get lower dimension spaces of our choosing. <br>

                We have shown 3D space foliation to get 2D spaces, 
                but the same principle applies to any d  imensions <br>
                For example, we can foliate our 4D universe and get our 3D spatial 
                universe at one point in time.Similarly, we can
                foliate a 5D space to get an embedded 4D space. 
                Or a 6D space to get an embedded 5D space, etc. <br> <br>
                
                When we talk, for example, of slicing (foliating) a 4D space to get a 3D space, 
                we call the 4D space a <b> hypervolume,</b> and the 3D space, a <b> hypersurface.</b>
                Likewise, any space of dimension greater than three can be termed a hypervolume 
                and the subspace obtained from foliating that, a hypersurface.

                So, our universe is a curved hypervolume when we consider it in the full 
                four dimensions of space and time. <br> <br>
                When we consider only the 3D spatial part, as a hypersurface embedded 
                in 4D spacetime, that hypersurface is flat. <br> <br>
                
                Note, we can also conceptualize our curved 4D universe as embedded in a flat 5D space. From that perspective,
                we have a 5D flat space with an embedded 4D curved space. But then, the 4D curved space has a flat 3D (spatial)
                space embedded in it.

            <h3>Positive vs Negative Curvature </h3>               
            <p>
            <div class="duecolonne">
                The 2D surface of a sphere is deemed by convention to have <b> positive curvature.</b> 
                If you start at any point on it,
                and move in any direction, you will curve “downward” in the same way. <br> <br>

                The 2D surface of a saddle, on the other hand, is different. 
                See Figure 2. If you start at some point, such as the
                middle of the saddle, and move in one direction, 
                you will curve downward. If you start at the same point, but move
                in a perpendicular direction, you will curve upward. 
                This kind of curvature is called <b> negative curvature </b> <br> <br>

                So if you move
                in two directions perpendicular to each other, if you curve in the same way the  space is positively curved,
                if you move in opposite ways the  space is negatively curved.
                
                if you are on a flat 2D surface, you won’t curve at all in any direction: zero curvature. 
                Similarly for higher dimension spaces. <br> <br>

                There are degrees of curvature, the value for curvature of a 2D surface on a 3D
                sphere is inversely proportional to the sphere radius squared:

                $$ 
                    R \propto   \frac{1}{r^2}

                $$

                For higher dimensional spaces, curvature R is inversely proportional 
                to the square of a radius-like number,
                which would correspond to a “sphere” in higher dimensions than 3.  <br> <br>

                Saddle shapes have negative curvature. The r value here corresponds to what the radius
                would be of a circle whose circumference is aligned with either 
                of the two perpendicular directions, i.e., the circle
                has the same curvature as that section of the saddle. <br>
                So, for a negatively shaped surface in any dimension, we will have curvature R.
                $$ 
                    R \propto   - \frac{1}{r^2}
                $$

                Note that the <b> curvature of the surface of a sphere is constant everywhere.</b>
                Wherever we measure we have the
                same value for radius r, and thus the same curvature R.
                <br> <br>

                For a surface that is not so uniform, such as an egg, 
                the surface curvature R would be different at the
                ends than at the middle.  <br> <br>

                An object in any dimension is said to have <b> maximal symmetry if the curvature everywhere is the same.</b>
                Hence, a sphere surface has maximum symmetry, 
                whereas that of an egg shell and a mountain’s terrain do not. <br> <br>

                In general, for hypersurface of dimension D, the curvature is
                $$ 
                R \propto   \frac{D(D-1)}{r^2}
                $$

                Mass-energy curves spacetime. This is the fundamental lesson from
                Einstein’s theory of general relativity (GR). <br>
                Crankinng all the considerable physics and math involved one finds the mass in it causes
                curvature of 4D spacetime, and this results in an attractive force 
                tending to pull the universe closer together. <br> <br>

                However, <b> there can be another cause for spacetime curvature,</b>
                something called the <b>cosmological constant. </b> <br>

                This is part of another term in the Einstein field equation for gravity.
                Up until 1998, was generally considered
                to be zero. <br>
                and was generally omitted from any general relativistic calculations. <br>
                But astronomical observations since that time have revealed 
                that this term is not zero, and the result has been Earth
                shaking for physics and cosmology. <br> <br>
                <b>cosmological constant </b> can be positive or negative. <br>

                <ul>
                    <li> <b> positive value </b> leads to positive 4D curvature of the universe, 
                    and a repulsion gravity force (i.e., anti-gravity, in lay terms). 
                </li>
                    <li> <b> negative value </b> yields negative 4D curvature and attractive gravity (like we are used to).                     
                    </li>                
                </ul> 

                our universe seems to have a positive cosmological constant. <br>
                This means matter in the universe is being repelled away from other matter, 
                and the universal expansion is accelerating. <br> <br>

                <div class="classriquadro">
                But we also have mass-energy, so the attractive 
                gravity from mass-energy is opposed by the repulsive gravity 
                from the cosmological constant. 
                </div>
                <br>
                Whichever of these
                is stronger will dictate whether our universal expansion is increasing (accelerating) or decreasing (decelerating).
                <br> <br>
                
                The cosmological constant appears to be constant in time. Thus, its effect
                does not diminish as the universe expands. <br> <br>

                <b>In the early universe </b> the mass-energy density effect was larger 
                than the cosmological constant effect, so the
                universal <b> expansion was continually slowing down.</b>
                <br> <br>
                Around 6 billion years after the Big Bang, the massenergy
                effect became so diluted, <b>the cosmological constant effect became the more dominant</b>
                of the two.  <br>

                As the universe evolved, the mass-energy effect became less and less, and relative to it, the cosmological constant effect
                became greater and greater.

                <div class="classriquadro">
                So, since that time of the transition in dominance of the two effects, 
                the universal expansion has been accelerating, speeding up.
                </div>

                Data from a number of sources confirm this effect. 
                <ul>
                    <li> supernovae brightness with
                        distance (redshift) variation,
                    </li>
                    <li> the CMBR, large scale structure of the universe (via early universe baryon acoustic
                        oscillations detection)                    
                    </li>                

                    <li> predicted abundances of primordial elements (Big Bang nucleosynthesis).
                    </li>
                </ul> 

                The cosmological constant can actually be modeled as a strange type of mass-energy 
                having positive mass but negative pressure. <br> <br>

                That is the cosmological constant term in the Einstein field equation can be 
                substitute by a mass-energy term having these particularly strange properties.  <br>

                <b>This mass-energy term is often referred to as a dark energy term </b>, 
                as it seems to result
                from some very weird type of mass-energy that is “dark”, i.e., we can’t see it. <br> <br>

                Many physicists believe it may arise
                from the vacuum in some yet to be understood manner. 
                Hence, it is also often referred to as a <b> vacuum energy.</b> <br> <br>

                If we model the universal acceleration cause as dark energy, 
                then we find it amounts to about 68% of the massenergy
                in the universe;
                what we in general call matter is equal to about 32%.
                And now we still have to discrimimate: <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        we can only see about 5% of all of this mass-energy, i.e. the 
                        <b> “normal” matter </b>(protons, neutrons,electrons, photons, neutrinos). 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        27% of it all is composed of some kind of something we call 
                        <b> dark matter</b>, which like dark energy, we cannot detect. 
                    </li>

                    <br> <br>

                    Presently dark energy density cannot be detected, it appear to change over time, unlike
                    matter density. <br>
                    This would be a characteristic one would expect of the vacuum, which should not change as the
                    universe expands and dilutes the density of material in it. <br>
                    <div class="classriquadro">
                    This is another reason why dark energy is considered by many
                    to be a vacuum phenomenon.

            De Sitter (dS) spacetime is defined as having:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    no matter (ordinary or dark)
                </li>

                <li>
                    having a positive cosmological constant (or in other terms, 
                    dark energy [that does not vary over time])

                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    This positive curvature causes the space to expand at an everincreasing
                    rate, i.e., it accelerates. 
                </li>

            </ul>
            It has nothing in it, no matter of any kind, but it has a
            distinct, and unusual, spacetime behavior.  <br> <br>

            Because the cosmological constant term in the Einstein 
            field equation is constant everywhere in space and time
            (by definition for de Sitter spacetime), 
            <b> the curvature it causes is the same everywhere. </b>
            
            It acts like the 4D hypersurface of a 5D hypersphere, 
            where the curvature everywhere on the hypersurface is the same.
            Thus, de Sitter space is maximally symmetric.
            <br> <br>
        
            Because de Sitter space has no mass-energy in it, but our universe does, 
            actually our universe is not a de Sitter
            universe. Rather our vacuum (which has no mass) is a de Sitter vacuum. 
            However, folks often take liberties by
            calling our universe a de Sitter space, 
            but strictly speaking that statement is not true.

Note that as the universe ages, after some time, its matter will get so diluted, the effect on curvature from it
will approach zero, and the cosmological constant effect will be virtually the whole show. In effect, we are moving
toward a universe that will, for all intents and purposes, be effectively a de Sitter universe. So, we approach a de
Sitter universe, as time t  ∞. One says our universe is asymptotically de Sitter.
