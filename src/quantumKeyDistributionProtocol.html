            <h3>Private and public Keys </h3>  
            <p> 
                Keys—binary strings or numbers chosen randomly from a sufficiently large set—provide the
                security for most cryptographic protocols. <br>
                For this reason, the establishment of keys between the parties who wish to communicate is of
                fundamental importance in cryptography. <br>
                Two general classes of keys exist: <b> symmetric keys and public-private key pairs. </b>
                Both types are used widely, often in conjunction, in a wide variety of
                practical settings, from secure e-commerce transactions to private communication over public
                networks. <br>
                Quantum key distribution protocols establish a symmetric key between two parties, called
                Alice and Bob.

                <h3>BB84 </h3>  
                <p> 
                    The earliest quantum key distribution protocol is known as BB84 after its inventors, Charles
                    Bennett and Gilles Brassard, and the year of the invention.
                    pag. 18  4 capoverso
                </p>        

                <p class="riquadro">
                    The aim of the BB84 protocol is
                    to establish a secret key, a random sequence of bit values 0 and 1, known only to the two
                    parties, Alice and Bob.
                </p>        
                <p class="riquadro">
                    The BB84 protocol enables Alice and Bob to be sure
                    that if they detect no problems while attempting to establish a key, then with high probability
                    it is secret. 
                    The protocol does not guarantee, however, that they will succeed in establishing a
                    private key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose Alice and Bob are connected by two public channels: an ordinary bidirectional classical
                    channel and a unidirectional quantum channel.
                
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/quantumComputing/aliceAndBob01.jpg" alt="Alice and Bob channels" title="Alice and Bob channels" width="400"
                            height="245">
                        <figcaption>
                            Fig.1 Alice and Bob channels <span style="font-style: italic"> </span>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    The quantum channel allows Alice to send a
                    sequence of single qubits to Bob. <br>
                    In our case we suppose the qubits are encoded in the polarization
                    states of individual photons. <br>
                    <b> Both channels can be observed by an eavesdropper Eve. </b>
                    Alice operates this way:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generate a random sequence of classical bit values</li>
                        <li>Encodes each bit of
                            this sequence in the polarization state of a photon choosing randomly
                            between two bases.
                            Standard basis
                            $$  | 0 \rangle \to    |\to  \rangle $$
                            $$  | 1 \rangle \to     |\uparrow  \rangle $$

                            $$  | 0 \rangle \to    |\nearrow  \rangle $$
                            $$  | 1 \rangle \to    |\nwarrow  \rangle $$  

                        </li>
