            <h3>Private and public Keys </h3>  
            <p> 
                Keys—binary strings or numbers chosen randomly from a sufficiently large set—provide the
                security for most cryptographic protocols. <br>
                For this reason, the establishment of keys between the parties who wish to communicate is of
                fundamental importance in cryptography. <br>
                Two general classes of keys exist: <b> symmetric keys and public-private key pairs. </b>
                Both types are used widely, often in conjunction, in a wide variety of
                practical settings, from secure e-commerce transactions to private communication over public
                networks. <br>
                Quantum key distribution protocols establish a symmetric key between two parties, called
                Alice and Bob.

                <h3>BB84 </h3>  
                <p> 
                    The earliest quantum key distribution protocol is known as BB84 after its inventors, Charles
                    Bennett and Gilles Brassard, and the year of the invention.
                    pag. 18  4 capoverso
                </p>        

                <p class="riquadro">
                    The aim of the BB84 protocol is
                    to establish a secret key, a random sequence of bit values 0 and 1, known only to the two
                    parties, Alice and Bob.
                </p>        
                <p class="riquadro">
                    The BB84 protocol enables Alice and Bob to be sure
                    that if they detect no problems while attempting to establish a key, then with high probability
                    it is secret. 
                    The protocol does not guarantee, however, that they will succeed in establishing a
                    private key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose Alice and Bob are connected by two public channels: an ordinary bidirectional classical
                    channel and a unidirectional quantum channel.

                        <figcaption>
                            Fig.1 Alice and Bob channels <span style="font-style: italic"> </span>

                    The quantum channel allows Alice to send a
                    sequence of single qubits to Bob. <br>
                    In our case we suppose the qubits are encoded in the polarization
                    states of individual photons. <br>
                    <b> Both channels can be observed by an eavesdropper Eve. </b> <br>
                    Alice operates this way:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generate a random sequence of classical bit values</li>
                        <li>Encodes each bit of
                            this sequence in the polarization state of a photon choosing randomly
                            between two bases.
                            Standard basis
                            $$  | 0 \rangle \to    |\to  \rangle $$
                            $$  | 1 \rangle \to     |\uparrow  \rangle $$  

                            Hadamard basis

                            $$  | 0 \rangle \to    |\nearrow  \rangle $$
                            $$  | 1 \rangle \to    |\nwarrow  \rangle $$  
                        </li>                        
                    </ul> 
                    Bob:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Bob measures the state of each photon he receives by randomly picking either basis.</li>
                        <li> Over
                            the classical channel, Alice and Bob check that Bob has received a photon for every one Alice
                            has sent, and only then do Alice and Bob tell each other the bases they used for encoding and
                            decoding (measuring) each bit.    </li> 

                        <li>When the choice of bases agree, Bob’s measured bit value agrees
                            with the bit value that Alice sent. </li>       

                        <li>When they chose different bases, the chance that Bob’s bit
                            matches Alice’s is only 50 percent (remember that changing the base measuring bacame no more deterministic). They do not reveal the bit values, which would
                            also reveal the values to Eve. So they simply discard all the bits on which their choice of bases
                            differed.</li>    

                        <li>Depending on the level of assurance they require, Alice and Bob compare a certain number of bit values to check that no
                            eavesdropping has occurred: same base must have same bit values else the bit state has been read by Eve.
                            Of course these bits will be discarded, and only the remaining bits will be used 
                            as their private key.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
